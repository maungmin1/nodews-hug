1. fork This project
2. Allow the "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them" button in the Actions menu.
3. After filling in the necessary variables in index.js within the hug branch, obfuscate and save it. The JavaScript obfuscation address is: https://obfuscator.io
4. Modify the image name in .github/workflows/build-hug-image.yml 44
5. Create an empty space on the hookface using Docker.
6. Create a new file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:
```
FROM ghcr.io/githubusername/mirrorname:latest

ENV DOMAIN=space域名
```
